# No Code

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```

```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

```

I know right?

### Running
To run your nocode creation, regardless of its content, see the sub-sections below for the appropriate command to run. 
However, you could optimize that by being true to the nocode spirit and just not type anything at the command prompt. 

#### Unix
From most Unix command line (shell):
```shell
% $(:)
% echo $?
0
```

#### MS-DOS
From the MS-DOS command prompt:
```shell
C:\Users\nada> call
```

#### MS-DOS
From the Windows command prompt:
```shell
C:\Users\nada> C:\Windows\hh.exe
```
